# Machine Learning Travel Planner
This repository contains an API that predicts travel time between two locations in Helsinki, Finland, using a machine learning model. 
The planner takes into account factors such as travel time and the mode of transportation to make the time prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix, which can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/3247564. The matrix provides travel times and distances between all pairs of grid cells in the Helsinki region. It includes information on various modes of transportation, including car, public transport, and walking.

The dataset is in CSV format and contains over 2 million rows of data. It was created using the Travel Time API provided by the Helsinki Regional Transport Authority. The data was collected in 2018 and includes information on travel times during different times of day and days of the week.
